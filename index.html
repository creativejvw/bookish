          <h3>Career Shift & Social Media </h3>
          <p>I'm currently on medical leave from teaching 6th grade English Language Arts. I love my school and students, but I had Covid right as my contract started and have a lot of breathing issues when I move around all day. I've always enjoyed technology and worked with it in some capacity, but now that health issues have taken me out of the classroom, I want to delve more deeply into technology via software engineering. </p>
